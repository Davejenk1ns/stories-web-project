# Steps to Create and Push to GitHub Repository

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Sign in to your GitHub account
3. Repository name: stories-web-project
4. Description: A web project that displays stories and photos, with both a simple web interface and a Django CMS backend.
5. Choose 'Public' or 'Private' visibility
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
7. Click 'Create repository'

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, run the following command to push your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

This will push your local repository to GitHub and set up tracking between your local and remote repositories.

## 3. Verify the Repository

After pushing, visit https://github.com/Davejenk1ns/stories-web-project to see your repository on GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues when pushing to GitHub, you may need to:

1. Use a personal access token instead of a password
2. Set up SSH authentication
3. Use the GitHub CLI for authentication

For more information, see GitHub's documentation on authentication:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
