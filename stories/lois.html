    <h1>Lois</h1>
    <div class="story-content">
<p>"Lois,  I . . . ", he gazed at the pendant hanging languidly about her neck,
 lacking the courage to look her in the eye. " . . .I don't know what I can say."

"Bruce-- Bruce you know I care about you.  It's just. . . " she too could only look at the immaculate silk tie, fearing a lack of resolve if she allowed herself to see his chiseled face, "it's, well,  . . . I just don't see this going anywhere long-term.  And I realize now that I really do love him.  I guess I was running away from that
commitment when I came to you."

"But I have real feelings for  you," he took her hand, and tried to project any honesty left in him through his eyes into hers.

"And I'll always have a special place in my heart for you." She placed her other hand on his cheek, drawing ever so slightly toward him-- a body signal to which his heart lept at the possibility of her return, "I ache every night when you're gone.  I never watch the news or look up into the night sky the same as I did before.  I just can't-- no. I won't let myself play second to your work-- as much as I believe in what you are doing and as much as I want to support you and as much as I love you and I know you need to do this and," her voice was stronger now-- her eyes narrowed slightly underlying the resolve and decisive nature of her speech. His heart began to melt again when he realized how hard this must be for her too and that figuring out this speech had been keeping her awake for probably days now " . . . and I never know when you'll be here or if you're coming back and I don't want to stand over your grave because I love you."

"Oh Bruce," she repeated more slowly and calmly, now that it had been said, "I DO love you."

His mind was reeling.  How many times had he heard this?  How many times had he been turned out with the words "I love you" still on her lips? There was Vicki, Chase, the faceless others.  Perhaps Selena was right those many years before.  She was the only one who understood him and accepted him.  Why couldn't he accept her?  Why did he keep chasing these "normal" women?  Did he fear what she brought out in him?  If Lois couldn't want him, he wanted-- no needed to know what she DID want.

"So.  You think you really like this guy-- Ken... Kent was it?"  Bruce pictured some ordinary schmuck.  Just another of the countelss masses he protected every day.  He began to hate them.  What did they know?  Could they ever grasp the enormity of his life?  Could they ever understand the gravity of his world?  How many times had he saved their stupid little lives so they could go on and steal his love?  Things had never been the same since the The Council had collapsed.  Yea-- he still did his job and he was rewarded with a 'thank you' once in a while, but it was going nowhere-- constant defense.  The Halls of Justice had tried to lay out things for a better world, but the outlines were too vague, the directions too scattered, the egos too big.  Diana believed in him back then-- but he was always second to the "greater good" or their common work.  He never broached the subject with her.  He lived in a split world.  The others had always warned him about bringing love into it.  They maintained the secrecy of the order, but he couldn't quite do it.  What was the point of saving the world if you couldn't love someone in it?

" . . . and he's sweet and consistent and there's not a dishonest bone in his body.  He says he loves me, and I believe him."  Bruce snapped back to attention.  She had been talking about this guy for at least three minutes and he had been wallowing in his own horror.  God, what a mess.  She was right.  It never could have worked anyway.  He should never have told her who he really was or what he did.  He hated his job.

The doorbell rang.  They looked at each other-- emotions now heightened by the tension from the fact that this was their last few seconds together.  Slowly, she drew her face to his and kissed him softly.  He moaned.  She squeezed the back of his neck with her hand and parted her lips slightly.  He melted even further.  Then, in one fluid motion she seemed to pass through him as she arose to walk toward the door.  The kiss seemed like some far-off illusion now, even though it had happened only seconds earlier.  He sighed, then arose while he brushed his suit lapels-- another vain attempt to regain some sense of dignity, profile.

She was at the door, knowing he was standing behind her, but training herself to concentrate on the man waiting to come in.  With the same fluidity she opened the door and there stood a well-cut figure at least the same height as Bruce holding a dozen roses in one hand and the other diplomatically placed behind him-- a pose that showed both elegance and simplicity.

Lois held out her hand to the figure. "Bruce, this is Clark Kent.  Clark, this is Bruce Wayne."

"You?!?"

"You."</p>
