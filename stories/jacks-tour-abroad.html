    <h1>Jack's Tour Abroad</h1>
    <div class="story-content">
<p>"Hakim . . . There's another one . . . next to the sandbar." Jack raised
his left arm and languidly extended his index finger, pointing out
another body that had somehow missed their last sweep of 'the pond'.

It wasn't really a pond-it was just a wide bend where the river
flattened out and the current slowed to form sand bars, islets, and a
small marsh on the inside of the angle.  Jack and Hakim soon figured out
this was the easiest spot to fish the bodies out of the water-- they
could usually stand on their skiffs about 2 meters in from the outside
bank, and the current would bring most of the large objects right to
them.

Hakim was on the port side today-which meant he was responsible for the
sand bars, while Jack took starboard, where he only had 2 meters of
current to worry about, but that's where most of the bodies came
through.

Jack watched Hakim awkwardly pole his way inwards to the sand bar. 
"Heh," Jack smirked to himself, "He's still afraid of getting wet."

Hakim made it to the sand bar, and jammed his long sounding pole into
the muck to steady the boat.  He reached down with both hands and hauled
the corpse into the back of his skiff.  "A Ooman!" Hakim shouted across
the pond to Jack, "Apuroximattlee theerty faife, maybe fourtee!"

Jack had his official light blue notebook that had to be turned in at
the end of every day.  He made small tick-marks in the appropriate
columns, folded the book in thirds, and stuffed it back into his
fishing-vest pocket. "Okay!  Got it!"

Jacks eyes went back to scanning the glen before him.  "It must be dying
down," he muttered, "Only 45 so far, and it's well past noon."

The first few days were horrible-well over 450 each day.  The fifth day
was the worst, 768 at his station alone.  Jack remembered how much his
back ached that night-it had been the worst day for his sunburn as
well.  But now, Jack and Hakim had settled into a routine, they soon
figured out the sweet spot in the currents and had divided the river
into portside and starboard, alternating each day.

Originally, there had been five personnel at his station, but the
other three quit after the first week.  Yuriko, The Japanese girl,
caught malaria and rotated out on day 6. Hans, the Dane (his name wasn't
really Hans, but Jack called him that because he really didn't give a
rat's ass what his name was and that sounded Aryan enough), cracked on
day 8, though Jack couldn't tell if it was from the death in the river
or the fear of catching malaria or AIDS or whatever.  Christian had left
on day 12, thinking he could get more done if he talked to the Unit
Coordinator downstream 5 miles-Jack wasn't sure if Christian had meant
"getting more done" meant fishing more bodies or forwarding Christian's
career in the organization faster.

That left Jack and Hakim-the two apathetics.  Hakim came from the camps
in Pakistan.  Jack wanted to ask if he was Mujahadeen, but thought
better of it, given that his own blue eyes and blonde hair might invoke
CIA/American Puppet suspicions in the man.  What little Hakim did say of
his life before this trip told Jack that Hakim was no stranger to death
on a mass scale, and that Hakim had long since surpassed religion and
philosophy on the temporary vagueness of the world.

Jack had been the shining star in the bureaucracy four weeks earlier. 
When the butchering began, his superiors were horrified that they hadn't
anticipated this, and that there really was no easy political or
military solution.  "Well, shouldn't we at least get the bodies outta
the river before they contaminate the whole downstream population?" Jack
had flippantly protested.  When American interests didn't reach far
enough, the State Department looked for cover from its New York office
, and the blue helmets were on their way.

He didn't need to go-his GS rating was three levels above this kind of
work-but he wanted to go.  He wanted to see what it was like-a primal
urge for chaos that had gotten him into trouble on more than one
occasion.

Jack was staring off into space.  His eyes were fixed on the upstream
entrance of The Pond, but his mind was somewhere else completely.  A
sudden splash broke his trance.  He looked to his left, and saw Hakim's
bright white smile against his dark complexion as Hakim reached down to
get another rock to skip across the surface.

"Jackson.  It is almoost taim, no?"  Hakim asked.

Jack looked at his watch-6:50PM.  "Yea," he answered, "ten more
minutes."

Fifteen minutes later the two of them were sitting on the hood of their
jeep at the top of the outside bank, eating some rice and flatbread they
had bought at the village 40 kilometers back through bush.  As they
relaxed in the cool of the evening, at least 4 more bodies slowly
floated through the glen.</p>
