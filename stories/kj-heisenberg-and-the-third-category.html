    <h1>KJ Heisenberg and The Third Category</h1>
    <div class="story-content">
<p>"Excuse me, Ma'am . . . ", Kathy softly knocked on the door of the
Director's office as she opened it.  "I know you wanted the Africa
assignment finished by 5:00PM, but I have a question on this one file .
. ."

The director looked up from reading the reports on her desk to peer over
the rim of her half glasses.  Her blue eyes seemed only more intense now
framed by her silver hair.  "That's quite alright.  I can't figure out
our objective on this whole East Timor mess anyway,"  She dropped her
highlighting pen in frustration, "What seems to be the snag?"

"Well," Kathy moved forward to hand the Director the brown folder, "the
Africa assignment needs five GS6s, and this one's a GS10.  He is way
above this kind of overseas clean-up work, yet he is on the list.  From
what I can see, he volunteered."

"How can you tell that?"  the director cocked her head up and peeled her
eyeballs down to begin reading the cover of the folder with her
bifocals.

"The handwriting, ma'am.  He wrote his own objectives and perogative
assignments.  The handwriting on those paragraphs match the script on
release forms."  Kathy extended a finger to point to the right half of
the folder, now splayed on the Director's oak desk.

The director blinked, then turned the folder to the inside back page. 
Finding the 10 digit alphanumeric, she turned to her terminal on the
corner of her desk and punched in the code.

"Aah.   Grey,  Jackson K.  MB67-594-DJ6.  Rated as GS10 with the NSA. 
Now on detachment with  . . . State Department-- huh.  What's he doing
over at State?  What's he doing volunteering for that mess in Africa?" 
The Director was mumbling, seemingly not realizing she was compromizing
security with Kathy there in the room.  Actually, she did realize what
she was saying, but she was close enough to retirement, and she liked
Kathy, so she had begun to 'leak' information around Kathy to ensure
that the young woman could replace her when she did leave.

The Director took five minutes glancing between the folder and the
terminal, as though she were piecing in the blank spots in Jackson's
record.

"Kathy," the Director now focused at the open dossier, "You should know
this one by now.  You've sent him out on five assignments like this
already."  The Director turned the dossier around on the desk and
pointed to the initials in the upper right-hand corner on five separate
pages.  "That is you, isn't it?  'KJ'?"

Kathy had never rifled through the whole folder before.  She had always
checked the top sheet for financial and department clearances and signed
them off to their destiny.  "Yes ma'am.  That is my 'KJ'."

"Well," the Director pushed the folder back across the desk to Kathy "If
the young Mr. Grey isn't dead yet, who am I to stop him from trying? 
Send him. --And Kathy-- I think you can start making these calls
yourself."

"Oh God," Kathy thought to herself, "was that a slam for bothering
her?"  The warm smile developing on the Director's face told her
otherwise.  It was no reproach, it was the Director's attempt at
foreshadowing, telling Kathy that she'll soon have the job herself.


---------------------------
In 1927, Werner Heisenberg enunciated 
the principle of "Unbestimmtheit",
which can be translated as "uncertainty".
In general, it can be shown that, if 
delta-X denotes the effective 
range in the possible values that
might be found by observation for 
the coordinate X of a given particle,
and if delta-P indicates the similar 
range for momentum, then:

      dXdP &gt;= h

where h is Plank's constant of the 
Universe.  In short, as soon as you
measure something, you cannot be 
sure of it's true position.

The way (Dao) that can be spoken of
Is not the constant way (Dao);
The name that can be named
Is not the constant name.

Kathy stared at Jackson's file for a long time.

For months, she had been secretly tracking on a yellow pad which files
didn't come back from which assignment.  She had also been
cross-referencing their numbers with this fatality rate-- hoping to find
some pattern or odd quirk.  Odd numbers?  Evens?  The ones with double
pairs?  Sequential?  There was no pattern.  But she had never felt any
guilt playing St. Peter with these files, because she had never known
their names . . .  they were just files.

Now she knew one.  What made it worse, this was The Anomaly Folder. 
She had filed this one in the 'Goat' pile at least four times now, and
he kept coming back.  Maybe that's why she went and bothered the
Director about it-- she wanted to know why this one kept defying her
categories.

Now she had measured him.
Now she had named him.

He's not a Sheep-- we were well beyond Sheep at this point (he would
never take a pansy assignment).  He's not a Goat-- he had come back from
too many of those to be a Goat.

Kathy stared at the folder on her desk until five minutes before 5:00PM.</p>
